    <h2>To my love Tia</h2>
    <p>
      Hey baby it's me Leo your favourite spanish man here, Hope you are liking this little surprise, I thought on giving you something before our trip.
      I know we have not met for long and we don't really know much about each other, but in such a short time you have become so important to me.
      I think it's amazing how we have connected so quickly, and I can't wait to see where this journey takes us. But first I want to give you this little gift, which is my very soul and heart.
      Please be aware this is not a normal gift, this is a part of me that I am giving to you, it's going to contain a lot of text so please take your time reading it (sorry! haha).
    </p>

    <p>
      We have gone briefly through some experiences from our pasts, you have told me about you and how you have been through a lot and I trully appreciate when we open up to each other, but I think it's time for me to open up to you so you can see the worst of me right now.
      I have been through a lot in my life, and I have made many mistakes. I have hurt people I love, and I have been hurt by people I trusted. But through it all, I have learned to be strong and resilient.
      I'm not perfect, and I have my flaws, but I am working on being a better person every day.
    </p>

    <p>
      As you may know, we both seem to have gone through the alone child experience, it is safe to say we both had a rough childhood, but I think that has made us stronger and more empathetic towards others.
      Throughout my life, I have always been the one to take care of others, to be there for them when they needed me. I have always been the one to put others before myself, even when it meant sacrificing my own happiness.
      I have always been the one to give my all to those I love, and I have always been the one to get hurt in the end. This has made me build walls around my heart, to protect myself from getting hurt again.
      My latest relationship was a both happiness and a total disaster, I was the worst version of myself, I was selfish, I was manipulative, and I was toxic. I hurt the person but yet I did gave them my all I never hesitated to put them first
      their happiness was my happiness, I left all the people I loved behind for her, I was so blinded by love that I didn't see the damage I was causing to myself, this lead to me becoming extremely attached and dependent on her
      leading to a toxic relationship that ended up hurting both of us.
    </p>

    <p>
      On top of that I was dealing with a lot of personal issues, I was struggling with my mental health (I think I still am) due to my mother's mental issues having to take care of her and my father being absent 
      most of the time, I was dealing with a lot of stress and anxiety, I was feeling lost and alone.
    </p>

    <p>
      It's been so long since then, I did overcome a heavy depression I lost my job at the time and almost was forced to leave my career. During the healing process, I had to relearn how to love myself and connect with others
      lots of these people who I thought were my friends ended up being people that I do not want to be around, girls that made me feel like they would be there for me but ended up being the same kind of toxic people I was trying to avoid.
      This story repeated itself over and over again throughout the year, to the point I built a wall, started hurting people that were trying to get close as a form of self defence due to my fear of them actually being fake and avoid the pain.
      I was so desperate to find friends and people to connect with that I ended up meeting my latest best friend, she was the first person in a while that I could call a friend, unfortunately due to her questionable behaviour and the fact she moved
      away to America I was forced to cut ties with them. After so many back and forths, I was left with no one, I was alone again, and I was scared, exhausted, and tired of trying to connect with people. I was ready to give up accept that maybe I was meant to be alone and maybe I deserved it,
      and was ready to just focus on myself and my career, I was ready to just be alone and not try to connect with anyone anymore.
    </p>

    <p>
      That's when one day I was scrolling throught that server I was recommended to join for "fun" and I saw your message, I was not expecting anything from it rather than just a casual conversation
      and a person to just play games with but I was so wrong, you were so different from anyone I had met before and I was so intrigued by you, I wanted to know more about you, I wanted to connect with you.
      The more time we spent together the more interested I became, you seemed to be looking for something similar to what I was looking for and I was so happy to find someone that understood me.
      The days past and we started to get closer and closer, I was starting to feel something I hadn't felt in a long time, I was starting to feel happy again, I was looking foward to talking to you every day, I was looking forward to spending time with you, I was looking forward to getting to know you better.
    </p>

    <p>
      But unfortunately I started to overthink everything, "maybe she just wants to be friends with benefits", "maybe she is just being nice to me because she feels sorry for me", "maybe she already has someone else". All these thoughts came to my mind and it hurt.
      So I decided to take a leap of faith and tell you how I felt, I was so scared of your reaction, I was so scared of you rejecting me, I was so scared of you leaving me, but I had to do it, I had to be honest with you and be clear that I wanted to see where things would take us.
      When you told me you were happy to do the same and that you were also interested in me, I was so relieved, I was so happy, I was so excited.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we talked more and more everyday I felt closer and closer to you, I wanted to know everything about you, but I could still hear the voice in my head telling me "this is too good to be true", 
      "she is going to leave you", "she is going to hurt you". So I kept the wall up and tried to not get too attached, but it was so hard, I was falling for you so fast and I didn't want to stop.
      The more time we spent together the more I realized that you were not like anyone I had met before, you were different, you were special, you were the person I had been looking for all this time.
      You are kind, caring, understanding and you have a heart of gold, you are everything I have ever wanted in a partner and more. That day I told you for the first time that I loved you, I meant it with all my heart.
      I haven't felt that way with anyone in a long time. I trully thought I could never love again or that I could never find anyone that could love me the way I wanted to be loved, but you proved me wrong.
      When you told me you loved me back, I was over the moon, I was so happy, I was so excited, I felt like I could finally breathe again, I felt like I could finally be myself again. But I must apologize
      because I'm still scared I still have this voice that keeps me up at night telling me that you are too good to be true, but I chose to ignore it, I chose to trust you, I chose to love you. And worst of all I'm getting jealous, I can't get that thought out that you are mine and mine alone.
      I know it's not healthy and I know I need to work on it, but I can't help it, I just want to be with you, I just want to hold you in my arms and never let you go. Everytime you mention a guy I get jealous, I know it's not rational and I must trust you so I will try my best to work on it so if you ever noticed me acting 
      off it is because of that, I'm a big overthinker.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will always try to be a better version of myself but I need you to be patient with me, I need you to understand that I am still healing from my past, as some thing still hurt, and that I am still learning how to love myself and how to love you.
      I know that I am not perfect and that I have my flaws, but I promise to always try my best to be the best partner I can be for you. I wish for us to be able to grow together and learn from each other, I want us to be able to support each other and be there for each other when we need it the most. But keep in mind I will always 
      be the pillar of support for you thats my goal to be the one my loved ones can come to when they need it, so I want you to come to me when you need it for absolutely anything, I will always be there for you.
    </p>

    <p>
      I want you to become my official girlfriend but I want to make the moment special and I want to make sure that you are ready for it, I don't want to rush things and I want you to know that I'm not perfect I'm human.
      I want this to be a journey we take together, a journey of love, trust, and understanding. I want us to be able to build a strong foundation for our relationship and to be able to weather any storm that comes our way.
      This is the most pure form of love I can give you which is the full truth of me, my mental state and my heart.
    </p>

    <p>
      So yeah, that's a my story and I hope you can understand me a bit better now, I know it's a lot to take in and I know it's not easy to read, but I wanted to be honest with you about everything.
      I'm way stronger and in a better place that I used to thats for certain and thats mainly why I feel ready to share this with you, I want you to know that I am not the same person I used to be, I 
      have grown and I have learned from my past mistakes and I'm constantly becoming better. 
      I'm ready for the next chapter in my life, and I want you to be a part of it. I want us to be able to build a future together, a future filled with love, cats, care and understanding.
    </p>
    <p>From the guy that loves you the most and your favourite idiota.</p>
    <p>- Leo</p>
